CSCI 3308: Project Part 1 – Proposal Submission + Repository

Who: Mason McNutt, Braden Romero, Slaton Spangler, Cameron Tierney

Title: (Chop)in: Music Discovery App

Description: An android app that will aids in the discovery of new music. It will play short segments of songs and the user will swipe to save/play /skip songs. New songs are selected based on artists’ influence on other artists. App will record all history and build playlists for user to go back to later. 

Vision statement: Our goal is to provide new and interesting musical possibilities to the masses while serving as a tool for artists to evaluate their music.

Motivation: We want to provide a music discovery system the sets itself apart from the other music apps (Pandora, Shazam, etc.).  Our app will be more fast paced, more about discovery, more active.

Risks: 
•	3/4 members have not developed for android
•	Storage/server needed for songs

Mitigation strategy for dealing with risks:
•	Project is small enough scope to make up for our lack of android and server experience
•	Utilize available resources to learn what we don’t know
